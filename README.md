## DDI representation of variables in repetitive contexts

### Objectives

The goal of this work is to study the representation of variables in DDI Lifecycle, specifically in iterative contexts: panels, cohorts, repeated surveys, periodic administrative files, etc.

Beyond the representation of variables, the work will also cover their organization into schemes and resource packages, and their relationships with other objects such as study units, physical instances, code lists, managed representations, etc.
