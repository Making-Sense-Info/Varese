# Guidelines

## Introduction

. Aim of the document, intended audience, etc.

## What are we talking about?

. variables and questions
. value domain representation
. high-level description of the variable cascade (without reference to DDI)
. what do we mean by repetitive and longitudinal contexts
. what do we want to represent and why (provenance, reproducibility, machine-actionability...)

## What does DDI-L provide?

. see CLOSER document
. grouping / packaging (schemes, groupes, resource packages...)
. relations (basedOn and others)
. the cascade in DDI
. universes and populations
. representations
	. code lists (categories / codes), controlled vocabularies
	. distinction between substantive and sentinel values (improved in CDI)

## Use cases

### For each use cases

- description
- what do we want to formalize and why?
- precise example in pseudo-DDI
- different possibilities with pros and cons

(for CLOSER use case, mention automated methods for finding relations: NLP...)
