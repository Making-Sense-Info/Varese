# Guidelines

## Introduction

- aim of the document, intended audience, etc.
- governance

## What are we talking about?

- variables and questions
- value domain representation
- high-level description of the variable cascade (without reference to DDI)
- what do we mean by repetitive and longitudinal contexts
- what do we want to represent and why (provenance, reproducibility, machine-actionability...)

## What does DDI-L provide?

- see CLOSER document
- grouping / packaging (schemes, groupes, resource packages...)
- relations (basedOn and others)
- the cascade in DDI
- universes and populations
- representations
	- code lists (categories / codes), controlled vocabularies
	- distinction between substantive and sentinel values (improved in CDI)

## Use cases

### For each use cases

- description
- what do we want to formalize and why?
- precise example in pseudo-DDI
- different possibilities with pros and cons

(for CLOSER use case, mention automated methods for finding relations: NLP...)

## What do we need (more that DDI-L)?

- baseOn categories

## Conclusions

- DDI provides different tools, additional ones are needed
- There is no perfect answer, it depends on multiple factors (effort in metadata modelling, needs of users, etc.)
