This workshop will study the representation of variables in DDI Lifecycle, specifically in iterative contexts: panels, cohorts, repeated surveys, periodic administrative files, etc. Il will build on the results already obtained during a [previous workshop](./2023-october.md) held in October 2023 with the participation of CLOSER, Constances and Insee teams.
