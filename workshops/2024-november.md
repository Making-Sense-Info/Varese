# November 2024 short meeting

Agenda:
- review of existing content
- distribution of work
- timeline

## Existing content

What we have so far:
- [Guidelines](../deliverables/guidelines.md)
- [Typology](../deliverables/typology.md)
- [Comparison overview](../workshops/comparison-overview.md)
- [Use cases](../use-cases/README.md)
- [WIP document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_pg73TyHgv1Z7QsPEmd2PLYaYCBaXvvFl487Dh3Ygp8/edit?tab=t.0)

## Who work on what?

The structure of the document is the one outlined in this [document](../deliverables/guidelines.md). 

The priority work is to review, amend and port the use cases to the Google doc, and specially to convey a theoretical solution in a graphical way using [the patterns](../workshops/comparison-overview.md).

Jon is concerned by that the theoretical solutions provided will necessarily fit for some needs (for example, user needs for discoverability) and not some others (easy data management). When possible though, applied patterns for use cases should provide "pros" and "cons" or at least some specifics benefits or drawbacks of choosing a pattern.

To-dos:
- Use cases documentation:
	- Closer use cases: Jon to quickly review, Romain to port to Google docs
	- Constances: Romain
	- Insee: Romain if no Insee colleague show up
	- CSDP: Lucie if she finds some times to work on the matter
	- France Cohortes: Vally and Vincent, with help from Romain
- "What are we talking about?" section
	- Thomas to review and amend

Next meeting: 28th of november, 2 PM EST - a short meeting to check the progress
