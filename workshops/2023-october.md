# DDI workshop on variable representation

## Dates and location

16-17 October 2023, Insee head office


## Objectives

This workshop will study the representation of variables in DDI Lifecycle, specifically in iterative contexts: panels, cohorts, repeated surveys, periodic administrative files, etc.

Beyond the representation of variables, the workshop will also cover their organization into schemes and resource packages, and their relationships with other objects such as study units, physical instances, code lists, managed representations, etc.

Expected outputs include guidelines on the topics covered, a roadmap for future work and a presentation for [EDDI 2023](https://events.geant.org/event/1457/).
