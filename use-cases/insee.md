# Insee use case for the DDI representation of variables in repetitive contexts

## General description 
### - Provide a description of the general context around the use case

At insee we have described about 25 studies, some of which are repetitions of the same statistical programme over time and for which we have described the variables represented. The basedOn relationships are used as much as possible to document the lineage between the represented variables.



## Sources and variables ()
### - Describe the variable to represent and how the data is produced
### - Describe the repetitive aspect

By exploring the DUMP of our Colectica database, we observe that we have around 800 relationships based on that have been described between the variables represented. In the article, we will focus our examples on the or the most mature statistical programmes in a repetitive context. 



## What do we want to represent?
### - Detail on what specific aspects of variable representation are important in the context (e.g. lineage, evolutions of concept or representation, etc.)

A typology of 800 basedOn relationships could be created to determine:
- what type of changes there are between the variables represented in practice (addition of codes, modification of the description, modification of the description to encompass metadata that should be elsewhere...).
- assess the extent to which current basedOn documentation allows more or less automatic comparisons to be made.
- This statistical approach could provide an overview of the priorities and difficulties encountered.

- we could open the discussion by analysing the gap between what exists and what should be used (in terms of representation, universe) to improve the documentation and actionability of metadata in a repetitive context.

- proposals or questions on the DDI L model could be formulated if necessary and possible.
