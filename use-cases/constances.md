# Constances use case for the DDI representation of variables in repetitive contexts

## General description

In order to meet the requirements of researchers and various institutions using Constances data, a clear and precise description of the different available variables (at enrollment and follow-up) must be accessible. For this first use case, we propose a focus on smoking-related data.

## Sources and variables

Smoking status was thoroughly investigated through a questionnaire, both at enrollment and during the study's follow-up, encompassing a total of 39 variables.
- 34 variables at enrollment (including 31 collected variables and 3 calculated variables).
- 5 variables at follow-up.

## What do we want to represent?

To better organize this data and facilitate decision-making, it is recommended to these variables in a standard DDI format. The detail of the variables available in the specific Excel table 
All described parts listed in the tables and also 
- Highlight comparable questions between inclusion and follow up
- Highlight participation (respondent) at each follow up
- Highlight the number on follow up wave for participants (median follow-up…)
