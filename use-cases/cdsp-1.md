# Use case for the DDI representation of variables in repetitive contexts

## Introduction

- Name and origin of the use case (institution, survey, information system), etc.

## General description
ELIPSS has a yearly core questionnaire (the Annual survey) to update sociodemgraphic data on panelists. Then, each month a new research survey is collected on a specific topic. The monthly survey can be cross-sectional (one-shot, for instance: a study on inclusive writing) or an additional wave of a longtudinal project (ex. Digital practices (wave 10)).



- Provide a description of the general context around the use case

## Sources and variables

- Describe the variable to represent and how the data is produced
- Describe the repetitive aspect

## What do we want to represent?

- Detail on what specific aspects of variable representation are important in the context (e.g. lineage, evolutions of concept or representation, etc.)
