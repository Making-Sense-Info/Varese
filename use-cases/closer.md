# CLOSER use case for the DDI representation of variables in repetitive contexts

## General description

- CLOSER Discovery is a multi-purpose discovery platform. Multi-purpose has a number of different contexts:
  - The subject areas are numerous
  - The users have different perspectives on how they want to use the available data resources
  - The representation of 'comparable' variables repeated within and across studies needs to reflect the various potential uses of the data
  - The same concepts may be asked in similar but not identical ways
 
- CLOSER will not (at least initially) attempt to 'harmonise' variables, e.g. to group variables using DDI Represented Variables
- We are proposing to compare questions (text and response domain) to identify related variables generated from these questions and assign them to conceptual variables

## Sources and variables

- Describe the variable to represent and how the data is produced
- Describe the repetitive aspect

## What do we want to represent?

- Variables which originate from the same or comparable questions will be identified
- A conceptual variable and description will be created at a study level
- A conceptual group and description will be created at a cross- study level
- Open questions are representation / ontolgies for other contextual information for which Controlled vocabulaires exists
- Existing vocabularies include mode, geographical coverage
- Other contextual information which may be candidates for CVs could be explored, e.g. administrative data,
